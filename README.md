## Task Instructions

On opening the project, you will be greeted with a table that lists ten items of data relating to periodic elements that is stored in a JSON file contained in the application. Each row also contains a button that when clicked will navigate to 'element.component'. 

**For this task, you will need to display a specific element's full data (position, name, weight and symbol) on the element element** 

When clicking the 'Details' button on each row, only that element's data should be displayed, and the displayed 'position' should match the number passed in by the URL. 

Only the element component should need to be modified.
